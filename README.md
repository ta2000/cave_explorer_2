# Cave Explorer 2
A game I will hopefully finish. More information will be added here when I
hopefully get further along.


## Cave Explorer
Here is a link to my [original cave
explorer](https://github.com/ta2000/cave_explorer) game, which I built on
windows and can no longer figure out how to build. Unforunately, I do not have
any video or screenshots of the original game. Cave Explorer was a top down dungeon crawl type game with periodic boss enemies and random gun pickups. Cave Explorer 2 (temporary title) game will be a more
finished version of the original, and will be in 3D.
